Microarray gene expression was conducted on mice hippocampal tissues. Two mice brains were used for each expermient .  The Microarray gene expression was conducted on hipocampus from LPS depression induced mice model(LPS group), LPS depression induced mice model treated with luteolin(LPS+L group), Normal mice (PBS group) and Normal mice treated with luteolin (PBS+L).
